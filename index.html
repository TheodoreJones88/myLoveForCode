      <h3>About Theodore</h3>
        <p>The first christmas gift I can remenber was a computer. Learning MsDos was my first interaction with a computer, so you can guess about how long ago that was. I have been in love with computers and coding since! When I was in my teens I loved creating little projects with friends. I'm excited to meet my new team to see what we can come up with!</p>

        <p>I'm so excited about my new journey with <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>. I've met so many people from this experience. I can't wait to meet and work with more! Maybe we can go out in my hometown in New Orleans and listen to some music! I love to listen to live music when I have some spare time and there's plenty of places to choose from there.</p>

        <p>I've been in Atlanta a total of 4 years. Being here has allowed me to immerse myself into this new tech world. I'm so ready to learn from my new teammates. I couldn't be happier taking this new path in my life!</p>
